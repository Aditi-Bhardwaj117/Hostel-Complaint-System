# Hostel-Complaint-System
The Hostel Complaint System is a project designed to streamline and automate the process of handling complaints in a hostel or similar residential facility. It provides an efficient and organized way for residents to report issues or problems they encounter and for hostel management to track, manage, and resolve those complaints.
